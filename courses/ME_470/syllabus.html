ME 470: Uncertainty Quantification: Techniques and strategies for tackling
unknowns in science and engineering research
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Uncertainty is a challenge. Representing a lack of knowledge, uncertainty
stymies our attempts to draw scientific conclusions, and to confidently design
engineering solutions. Failing to account for uncertainty can lead to false
discoveries, while over-reacting to uncertainty can lead to overbuilt
engineering designs. Overcoming these issues requires identifying, quantifying,
and managing uncertainties through a combination of technical skills and an
appropriate mindset. This class will introduce modern techniques for quantifying
and propagating uncertainty. Issues of dimensionality will be discussed.
Emphasis will be on applying techniques in genuine applications, through
assignments, case studies, and student-defined projects.
</p>

<p>
Prerequisite: Basic probability and statistics at the level of CME 106 or equivalent.

Content will be delivered through a number of different formats, described
below. All in-class delivery strategies will be adjusted to use modern,
research-backed principles and strategies to promote learning outcomes &#x2013; active
learning.

<h4 id="sec-3-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.1</span> Lecture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<p>
Much of the class format will follow a fairly traditional lecture format.
However, I will take steps to introduce small adjustments to make lectures more
engaging (not all active learning involves large changes!). Lectures will
generally start with some form of <i>challenge statement</i> &#x2013; an open-ended
question meant to get you thinking about high-level concepts. I am very much
open to questions during lecture, and plan to turn discussion over to small
groups or the full class as is appropriate.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<p>
A handful (five planned) of in-class sessions will follow a <i>lecture based
tutoring</i> format.[Easton, (2018) ASEE] These will be interactive,
instructor-guided, student-driven activities mean to reinforce concepts learned
in previous lectures. I will introduce some science or engineering problem, and
<i>execute</i> live coding to address the task in real time. However, all <i>decisions</i>
will be given by the students. I will call on students to decide how to proceed,
and implement those solutions: We will either find a solution to the problem
together, or determine how proposed solutions do not work. We will rapidly
rotate through students to engage the entire class. In this way, the class &#x2013; as
a team &#x2013; will practice concepts, see how other students think, and discuss
relevant content together.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">
<p>
There will be a small number (four planned) of take-home problem sets, which
will follow a fairly standard format. They will consist of a small number of
fairly involved problems; some will be intended to solidify concepts covered in
class, such as implenentation or derivation problems. Others will emphasize
executive function &#x2013; I will pose an open-ended problem, and you will need to
select and justify an approach. In all problems, the emphasis will be on
understanding and justifying the analysis &#x2013; this will be reflected in the
grading scheme as well.

<h4 id="sec-3-1-4"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.4</span> Project</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-4">
<p>
There will be a student-initiated final project; you will pose a problem you
would like to solve, describe your approach, and summarize your findings. The
topic can be drawn from any area (ideally your research), but must involve some
concept discussed in class. Projects will be carried out individually; if you
are working with other students on the same research project, you must either
choose different topics, or split the project into different components. The
project Report itself is intended to involve an amount of work comparable to a
single homework assignment; however, there are additional components around the
project (Peer Review and Presentation) that will constitute additional work.
Accordingly, the deliverables for the project are spread over the latter half of
the course.

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-3-1-4-1" name="sec-3-1-4-1"></a>Proposal<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-1-4-1">
<p>
By the midpoint of the class, you will submit a one-page Proposal for your
project. In this assignment, you must
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Describe the problem you aim to solve
</li>
<li>State what approach you plan to use
</li>
<li>Hypothesize what will be the result
</li>
<li>State your personal learning goals for this course, and articulate how this
project will serve those goals
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to ensure you are on track to deliver a
compelling project at the end of the course.

<li><a id="sec-3-1-4-2" name="sec-3-1-4-2"></a>Draft and Peer Review<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-1-4-2">
<p>
In week 8, you will submit a Draft report for your project. This will be used
for a Peer Review exercise, in which you will review two other students' draft
work. This will primarily be an exercise in providing useful commentary on other
researchers work &#x2013; a critical component of the academic enterprise.
</p>

<p>
For the Draft, you must:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Describe your problem
</li>
<li>State your approach
</li>
<li>Describe your (preliminary) results
</li>
<li>Note what you plan to do for the final submission
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the Peer Review, you must:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Summarize what the work aims to do
</li>
<li>State both strengths and weaknesses of the work
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From a writing perspective
</li>
<li>From a technical / methodological perspective
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide recommendations on how to improve the work
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Draft will be graded for completeness. Peer Review will be graded for
quality, based on a provided rubric. Note that, to simulate a more 'traditional'
peer review process, we'll leave the learning goals out of this phase. This is a
concession to normative research values in academia, but is not a reflection of
the value of learning goals.

<p>
The final days of the class will be reserved for student Final Presentations.
These will (aspirationally) be 15-minute talks, though depending on enrollment
we may need to adjust this amount of time. The purpose of presentations is to
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>practice communication skills, 2. introduce the class to the variety of
</li>
</ol>
<p>
problems being tackled in UQ, and 3. reflect on how the project (and class)
addressed your learning goals in taking the class.

For the Report, you must:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Describe your problem
</li>
<li>State your approach
</li>
<li>Argue how your results show that you solved the problem, OR note what would

The majority of assignments are problem sets, with a small number of extensive
problems intended to reinforce concepts learned in class. Each problem set will
include at least one `open-ended' question that will stretch your executive
reasoning, and require you to make and justify analysis choices. The project is
essentially a large, student-defined assignment. It includes additional
components above a normal problem set, described above.

Assignment late policy:
</p>

<p>
Assignment due-dates are listed below in the 'Content Sequence' subsection. All
assignments are due at the beginning of class on the specified date. Assignments
are considered late if not submitted at the specified time. Late assignments may
be submitted for partial credit, though they will not be graded in detail, and
will receive a <i>maximum</i> partial credit depending on the number of late days:
</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Of course, in extenuating circumstances, exceptions to this policy will be made.
Examples of reasonable exemptions include issues of health, family emergencies,
and other unforeseeable circumstances. If you have planned events that may
impede an assignment deadline (e.g. conference travel), please come discuss your
situation with me, and we'll try to work something out.
</p>

<p>
Assignment re-grade policy:
</p>

<p>
Re-grades must be requested within one week of the assignment's return date; no
exceptions will be made. If you think a grading decision is genuinely in error,
please feel free to contact the teaching team (in a timely manner).
</p>

<p>
Assignment re-submission:
</p>

<p>
Generally, I would prefer that you take assignment feedback and incorporate it
into future assignments. In extenuating circumstances, I may consider a
re-submission of an assignment. In this case, the maximum grade that may be
earned is the previous grade plus half the deficit; for example, if one scored a
50% on an assignment, the maximum re-submission grade will be 75%.
Re-submissions will only be accepted until a week after the relevant assignment
has been returned.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Both formative and summative feedback will be deployed in this class, though the
emphasis will be on feedback to help students develop (formative), and less on
assigning grades (summative).
</p>

<p>
Formative feedback will be provided through in-class case studies, as I will be
able to gauge student understanding in real-time. Additional feedback will be
provided through peer review, as students will both get commentary on their
work, and be afforded to see how other students conceptualize the material.
Finally, all assignments will include some amount of open-ended problem solving
that will require executive thought &#x2013; students are welcome and encouraged to
attend office hours to discuss these not-straightforward problems.
</p>

<p>
Summative feedback will be deployed in grading the assignments and final
project. More is stated below in the Grading Philosophy.

<h3 id="sec-4-2"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Grading Philosophy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
This is an upper-level graduate course. My assumption is that students taking
this class are primarily engaged in research, and are now taking courses to
support that activity. Thus, my expectation is that this class is of secondary
importance in your current workload, and my grading philosophy is formulated
with this assumption in mind.
</p>

<p>
There will be four homeworks and a final project, in order to minimize the
external workload for the class. I would like to grade the in-class assignments,
but I realize that upper-level graduates will need to miss classes for
conferences and the like. The class has been designed around reinforcing
concepts through these in-class activities, so please do not take my lack of
point assignment as an indication of the relative importance of these
activities.
</p>

<p>
The four homeworks will compose half of your grade, with the final project
weighted equally. The final project is further broken down into the final report
(delivered both through presentation and in writing), and the peer review stage.
The relative weight of Project components is intentional.

<p>
It is common in upper-level graduate courses to be <i>lenient</i> in grading, and I
have every intent to do the same in this class. You are researchers at this
stage &#x2013; we should be beyond ``playing the game of school'' by now.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Since this is an upper-level graduate course, I will assume a fair amount of
background knowledge on your part. However, I realize some topics are often not
well-covered in a `traditional' engineering curriculum, and you may feel
uncomfortable with some of the necessary topics. I have sequenced the content
with this fact in mind, and make specific my expectations for background
knowledge below.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-5-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.1</span> Engineering Mathematics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<p>
All students in this class should be fairly mature in their mathematical
ability. By this I do not mean proof writing, but strong proficiency with
calculus and linear algebra is required. Many of our motivating examples will
come from dynamical systems, so some familiarity with ODE's will be helpful, but
not necessary.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-5-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.2</span> Probability</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
Most engineering curricula include some amount of probability theory, but many
of the engineers I know are not as comfortable manipulating random variables as
they are PDE's. To feel comfortable in this class, you should know what a
continuous random variable is, have seen PDF's and CDF's before, have computed
some expectations, and have done some Gaussian manipulations at some point in
your life. We will review probability theory, so don't worry if you need to dust
off these skills a bit. My hope is to reactivate this knowledge, and add a
little bit more to your understanding of random variables.

<p>
Many of the engineers I know never took a statistics course; or, if they did,
feel totally uncomfortable with even the basic concepts. We will have to play
this topic by ear, you and I. I plan to teach the bare minimum content we'll
need for understanding critical UQ concepts, though we may need to shuffle
topics and borrow time, depending on how the class is feeling.

<p>
This course is meant to <i>start</i> a shift in your mindset and toolkit. Like any
kind of learning, grappling with uncertainty is a lifelong journey. I recommend
the following 'post-requisites' to build upon the ideas introduced in this
course. Note that these are current as of the 2018-19 academic year:
</p>

<p>
STATS 305A: Applied Statistics I
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All about (multivariate) regression, with a focus on practical concerns. I
found this course very helpful for building intuition in statistics, but also
found it rather challenging with an engineer's background in statistics.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
STATS 362: Topic: Monte Carlo
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Art Owen infrequently teaches this class on the Monte Carlo method. There are
a lot of practical considerations and subtleties &#x2013; I would take it if you
find the chance!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
CS 228: Probabilistic Graphical Models
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Specialty class on using probabilistic graphical models for (machine)
learning. These form a very flexible, powerful framework for Bayesian
inference, and are an exciting area of current research.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
CS 238: Decision Making under Uncertainty
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I hear wonderful things about Mykel Kochenderfer's Decision making under
uncertainty course. He has great skill in explaining complex topics in a lucid
way.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
ENGR 150: Data Challenge Lab
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very unique course; by application only. Intensive course on data science &#x2013;
teaches visualization techniques and exploratory data analysis.
</li>
