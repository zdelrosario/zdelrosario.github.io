This is my personal site: It's essentially an extended CV. See [[./zdr_cv.pdf][this]] for my more
traditional CV. My email is zdrcrow@stanford.edu (remove any corvids if you're
not a robot).

* Mission and Skills
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:mission
:end:

I believe false certainty is one of the greatest challenges we face in the 21st
century. False certainty contributed to voter complacency in the 2016
election.cite:silver2017 Citing a lack of certainty is the favorite tactic of
climate change deniers.cite:shapiro2018 Generally, people tend to seek absolute
knowledge where it does not exist, closing themselves off from the possibility
of learning. My research, teaching, and service are all connected to the same
goal -- helping us manage uncertainty.


I have a unique blend of skills that I leverage in my work:
** Human-centered Engineering
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:engineer
:end:

I first trained as a mechanical engineer at [[http://www.olin.edu/][Olin College of Engineering]], whose
curriculum emphasizes a [[http://www.olin.edu/academics/curriculum/][people-first]] approach to problem solving. There I
developed the tools and mindset to identify and frame human problems -- a
skillset I carried to my graduate studies. At Stanford I am pursuing a PhD in
Aerospace Engineering under the supervision of [[http://web.stanford.edu/~jops][Gianluca Iaccarino]] and [[https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/art-b-owen][Art Owen]].
This unique combination of investigative and analytic skills enabled me to
effectively interview numerous engineers while interning at Northrop Grumman
Corp., which directly led to my work on [[#subsec:margin][principled margin]].

** Statistics and Data Science
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:stats
:end:

While at Stanford, I've had the great fortune to learn from classical
statisticians ([[https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/art-b-owen][Art Owen)]] and data scientists ([[http://hadley.nz/][Hadley Wickham)]]. I'm an alum of
the [[https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab][Data Challenge Lab]], and I incorporate statistics and data science in my
research, teching, and service. My graduate training in statistics has enabled
me to pursue a more rigorous treatment of uncertainty in my work on [[#subsec:margin][principled
margin]], and my training in data science and visualization has influenced my work
on [[#subsec:insight][algorithms for insight]].

** Pedagogy
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:teacher
:end:

I have also pursued formal training in teaching at Stanford. I had the great
fortune to learn from [[https://profiles.stanford.edu/sheri-sheppard][Sheri Sheppard]], both through her class on course design
(ENGR 312), and through collaborating on [[#subsec:asee][ASEE Stanford Chapter]] events. I was
recognized by Stanford VPTL for my teaching abilities, and was hired as a
[[#subsec:vptl][teaching consultant]] in the autumn of 2018.

* Research
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:research
:end:

I am interested in how information flows through the engineering design process.
Modern advances in data collection, computation, and algorithms have opened the
door to new ways to find engineering and scientific insights. These developments
enable new approaches to old engineering problems, and promise increased
efficiency and safety.

** Principled Margin
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:margin
:end:

Engineers design safe solutions for human needs. Designers achieve safety in
part through engineering margins. My work on Principled Margin is focused on
deriving data-driven engineering margins with provable properties.

Selected Publications:
- "Cutting the Double Loop: Theory and Algorithms for Reliability-Based Design
  Optimization with Statistical Uncertainty":cite:zdr2018_double_loop In this
  work, I derive a /provably-conservative design margin/ for engineering design
  under uncertainty.

#+caption: Example results from "Cutting the Double Loop"; my novel margin in probability (MIP) approach is provably-conservative, leading to quantifiable properties in the resulting design.
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[./images/M_tension.jpg]]

- "Beyond Basis Values: Fast Precision Margin with FORM":cite:zdr2019 In this
  work, I further develop the techniques introduced in "Cutting the Double
  Loop", and introduce algorithmic advances to enable fast computation of
  precision margin. With my collaborator [[http://adl.stanford.edu/people/rickfenrich.html][Rick Fenrich]], we demonstrate these
  techniques on the design of a complex, multi-physics supersonic nozle.

#+caption: Schematic depiction of nozzle design. With Rick, I demonstrated that designing this expensive, complex engineering system with principled margin is feasible.

** Algorithms for Insight
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:insight
:end:

The pace and output of engineering and science has changed. Where the analysts
of yesterday made brilliant insights based on sparse observations, today's
engineers and scientists are faced with a torrent of conflicting data. My work
on Algorithms for Insight is focused on physics-constrained algorithms to
extract relevant insights.

Selected Publications:
- "Developing Design Insight Through Active Subspaces":[[cite:zdr2017]] In this
  /award-winning/ paper (Jefferson Goblet, AIAA SciTech 2017), I demonstrate the
  use of modern model-reduction techniques to gain qualitative insights into
  engineering systems. For instance, I show that one can recover classical
  insights into aircraft design through an /automated, data-driven approach/.

- "Lurking Variable Detection via Dimensional Analysis":cite:zdr2017f In this
  work, I introduce techniques to detect /unknown unknowns/, so-called lurking
  variables. These techniques are based on classical ideas of /dimensional
  analysis/ -- the idea that physical phenomena are ultimately independent of
  human-defined measurement systems. I re-interpret this classic insight in a
  modern context to enable lurking variable detection.

* Teaching
** ME 470: Uncertainty Quantification
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:me470
:end:

I will be teaching the Stanford course ME 470: Uncertainty Quantification in the
Spring quarter of 2019. I'll have more to say about this after that point....

** VPTL Teaching Consultant
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:vptl
:end:

I have been a [[https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/ta-support/grad-teaching-stanford/liaisons-and-consultants-programs/become-vptl-consultant][Teaching Consultant]] with the Office of the Vice Provost for
Teaching and Learning (VPTL) since the Autumn of 2018. As a consultant, I have
been recognized for my teaching skills, and leverage these abilities to train my
peers. Through VPTL I provide a variety of professional-development services to
other Stanford graduate students, aimed at helping them improve their teaching
skills. I leverage a combination of in-class experience and knowledge of the
education literature in these consultations, and strive to help folks recognize
and develop their unique teaching style.

* Service
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:service
:end:

** ASEE Stanford Chapter President
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:asee
:end:

I have been involved with the [[https://www.asee.org/][American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE),
[[http://asee.stanford.edu][Stanford Chapter]] since 2016. Now I serve as the chapter president, organizing
our portfolio of events with our officer team. Stanford ASEE offers a seminar
sequence and annual colloquium. During my work with the chapter, we produced the
2018 Colloquium on [[https://web.stanford.edu/group/asee/cgi-bin/wordpress/events/current-years-events/][Education at Scale]], which examined the challenges and
opportunities of scale facing educators in the modern context. We also
introduced a journal club, which allows members to dig more deeply into the
education literature.

** SeeME co-Founder and Director of Curriculum
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:seeme
:end:

With my labmate Ohi Dibua, I founded [[http://seeme.stanford.edu][SeeME]] in the fall of 2016. SeeME is an
outreach program hosted by Stanford Mechanical Engineering which seeks to 1. Get
kids from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds excited about science and
engineering, and 2. equip Stanford graduate students with teaching and speaking
skills. Our inaugural event was well-received, and garnered support from both
the department and the [[https://news.stanford.edu/2018/04/30/graduate-students-teach-local-teens-engineering/][university at large]].
