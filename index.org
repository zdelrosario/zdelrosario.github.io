:custom_id: sec:hello

* Mission and Skills
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:mission
:end:

I believe false certainty is one of the greatest challenges we face in the 21st
century. False certainty contributed to voter complacency in the [[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-story-of-2016/][2016 election]].
Citing a lack of certainty is the favorite tactic of [[http://theconversation.com/the-thinking-error-at-the-root-of-science-denial-96099][climate change deniers]]. In
my own work, I have found that the /reification/ of variable material properties
in Engineers' minds has lead to undiagnosed vulnerabilities in the aircraft
design process.

Generally, people tend to seek absolute knowledge where it does not exist,
closing themselves off from the possibility of learning. My research, teaching,
and service are all connected to the same goal -- helping us manage uncertainty.


I have a unique blend of skills that I leverage in my work:
** Human-centered Engineering
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:engineer
:end:

I first trained as a mechanical engineer at [[http://www.olin.edu/][Olin College of Engineering]], whose
curriculum emphasizes a [[http://www.olin.edu/academics/curriculum/][people-first]] approach to problem solving. There I
developed the tools and mindset to identify and frame human problems -- a
skillset I carried to my graduate studies. At Stanford I am pursuing a PhD in
Aerospace Engineering under the supervision of [[http://web.stanford.edu/~jops][Gianluca Iaccarino]] and [[https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/art-b-owen][Art Owen]].
This unique combination of investigative and analytic skills enabled me to
effectively interview numerous engineers while interning at Northrop Grumman
Corp., which directly led to my work on [[#subsec:margin][principled margin]].

** Statistics and Data Science
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:stats
:end:

While at Stanford, I've had the great fortune to learn from classical
statisticians ([[https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/art-b-owen][Art Owen)]] and data scientists ([[http://hadley.nz/][Hadley Wickham]]). I'm an alum of
the [[https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab][Data Challenge Lab]], and I incorporate statistics and data science in my
research, teaching, and service. My graduate training in statistics has enabled
me to pursue a rigorous treatment of uncertainty in my work on [[#subsec:margin][principled
margin]], and my training in data science and visualization has influenced my work
on [[#subsec:insight][algorithms for insight]].

** Pedagogy
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:teacher
:end:

I have also pursued formal training in teaching at Stanford. I had the great
fortune to learn from [[https://profiles.stanford.edu/sheri-sheppard][Sheri Sheppard]], both through her class on course design
(ENGR 312), and through collaborating on [[#subsec:asee][ASEE Stanford Chapter]] events. I was
recognized by Stanford VPTL for my teaching abilities, and was hired as a
[[#subsec:vptl][teaching consultant]] in the autumn of 2018.

* Research
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:research
:end:

I am interested in how information -- in a broad sense -- flows through the
engineering design process. Modern advances in data collection, computation, and
algorithms have opened the door to new ways to find engineering and scientific
insights. These developments enable new approaches to old engineering problems,
and promise increased efficiency and safety. The following are major themes of
my research:

** Principled Margin for Aircraft Design
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:margin
:end:

Engineers design safe solutions for human needs. Designers achieve safety in
part through /engineering margins/ -- essentially 'padding' in the quantitative
values used for design. If you've ever put aside money for a rainy day, you're
not just fiscally responsible -- you've built margin into your finances! My work
on principled margin is focused on deriving data-driven engineering margins with
provable properties.

*** A Dangerous, Reified Mindset
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House:_The_Spread_of_Excellence_from_Plato_to_Darwin][Gould]] tied the notion of /reification/, "the mental conversion of a person or
abstract concept into a thing," to failed statistical reasoning. [[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/useless-arithmetic/9780231132121][Pilkey and
Pilkey-Jarvis]] tie this fallacy to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery][dramatic failures]] in environmental science.
They quote Gould to illustrate the key issue,

#+begin_quote
"We abstract the variation within a system into some measure of central tendency
like the mean value and then make the mistake of reifying this abstraction and
interpreting the mean as a concrete thing."
#+end_quote

Engineers also commit this reification in considering /material properties/ as
simple, single numbers to be plugged into models. In my PhD thesis, I worked to
articulate the failure modes of these /reification errors/ in the context of
aircraft structural design, and developed provably safe alternatives.

#+caption: /Widely-used aircraft design strategies have fundamental flaws./ The use of /basis values/---conservative, reified material properties---can lead to a misleading safe diagnosis of structures. Note that the `Apprx.` Limit State value using a basis value indicates a safe structure for `2`, while the `True` value is unsafe. This and other issues in aircraft design arise from a reified view of material properties, and require a more rigorous approach to guarantee aircraft safety.

*** A Provably Safer Approach

Rigorously treating uncertainties in science and engineering is the study of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification][uncertainty quantification]] (UQ). As a researcher in UQ, I use a combination of
domain knowledge of aircraft design and rigorous statistics to solve engineering
problems. I have developed alternatives to traditional structural design
criteria which possess /provable safety properties/. These approaches are
data-informed to add a rigorous amount of design margin.

#+caption: /Provably-conservative margins enable a user-selected safety level./ Example results from "Cutting the Double Loop"; my novel margin in probability (MIP) approach is provably-conservative, leading to quantifiable properties in the resulting design.

*** Selected Publications
- [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.6035]["Cutting the Double Loop: Theory and Algorithms for Reliability-Based Design
  Optimization with Statistical Uncertainty"]] (2018, IJNME): In this work, I
  introduce a framework for analyzing and formulating /rigorous design margins/
  for engineering design under uncertainty. I derive a number of constructs,
  including /margin in probability/ (MIP), which possesses provable safety
  properties that satisfy current [[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/25.613][FAA Regulations]].

- [[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2019-0721]["Fast Precision Margin with the First-Order Reliability Method"]] (2019,
  AIAA Journal): In this work, I further develop the techniques introduced in "Cutting
  the Double Loop", and introduce algorithmic advances to enable fast
  computation of precision margin. With my collaborator [[http://adl.stanford.edu/people/rickfenrich.html][Rick Fenrich]], we
  demonstrate these techniques on the design of a complex, multi-physics
  supersonic nozzle.

- [[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2019-3554]["Margin as Model: Some Answers to "How Many Tests Should I Perform?""]] (2019,
  AIAA Aviation Forum): In this work, I apply principled margins to support
  various engineering design questions, including the optimal allocation of a
  test budget for materials characterization.

- "When are Design Allowables Conservative?" (To be presented at AIAA SciTech
  2020): In this work, I analyze the /design allowables framework/---the current
  aircraft design criteria for handling uncertain material properties---in terms
  of aircraft safety. The current criteria are safe but inefficient for simple
  structures, but grow increasingly dangerous for more advanced, modern designs.
  My work on Principled Margin---MIP and other constructs---provably solves
  these issues.

** Algorithms for Insight
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:insight
:end:

The pace and output of engineering and science has changed. Where the analysts
of yesterday made brilliant insights based on sparse observations, today's
engineers and scientists are faced with a torrent of conflicting data. My work
on Algorithms for Insight is focused on physics-constrained algorithms to
extract relevant insights.

Selected Publications:
- [[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2017-1090]["Developing Design Insight Through Active Subspaces"]]: In this
  /award-winning/ paper (Jefferson Goblet, AIAA SciTech 2017), I demonstrate the
  use of modern model-reduction techniques to gain qualitative insights into
  engineering systems. For instance, I show that one can recover classical
  insights into aircraft design through an /automated, data-driven approach/.

- [[https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/17M1155508]["Lurking Variable Detection via Dimensional Analysis"]]: In this
  work, I introduce techniques to detect /unknown unknowns/, so-called lurking
  variables. These techniques are based on classical ideas of /dimensional
  analysis/ -- the idea that physical phenomena are ultimately independent of
  human-defined measurement systems. I re-interpret this classic insight in a
  modern context to enable lurking variable detection.

** ME 470: Uncertainty Quantification
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:me470
:end:

I will be teaching the Stanford course ME 470: Uncertainty Quantification in the
Spring quarter of 2019. I'll have more to say about this after that point....

For now, [[./courses/ME_470/syllabus.html][here's the syllabus]].

** VPTL Teaching Consultant
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:vptl
:end:

I have been a [[https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/ta-support/grad-teaching-stanford/liaisons-and-consultants-programs/become-vptl-consultant][Teaching Consultant]] with the Office of the Vice Provost for
Teaching and Learning (VPTL) since the Autumn of 2018. As a consultant, I have
been recognized for my teaching skills, and leverage these abilities to train my
peers. Through VPTL I provide a variety of professional-development services and
workshops to other Stanford graduate students, aimed at helping them improve
their teaching skills. I leverage a combination of in-class experience and
knowledge of the education literature in these consultations, and strive to help
folks recognize and develop their unique teaching style.

* Service
:properties:
:custom_id: sec:service
:end:

** ASEE Stanford Chapter President
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:asee
:end:

I have been involved with the [[https://www.asee.org/][American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE),
[[http://asee.stanford.edu][Stanford Chapter]] since 2016. Now I serve as the chapter president, organizing
our portfolio of events with our officer team. My goal as president has been to
build a robust community of educators at Stanford, providing a network for those
students, staff, and faculty who are passionate about education.

Stanford ASEE offers a seminar sequence and annual colloquium. During my work
with the chapter, we produced the 2018 Colloquium on [[https://web.stanford.edu/group/asee/cgi-bin/wordpress/2018/04/11/asee-colloquium-education-at-scale-april-20th-845am-1230pm/][Education at Scale]], which
examined the modern challenges and opportunities of scale, and the 2019
Colloquium on [[https://web.stanford.edu/group/asee/cgi-bin/wordpress/2019/04/17/asee-colloquium-april-19th-2019/][The Fundamentals of Teaching]], where participants learned the key
skills for effective pedagogy through interactive workshops. We also introduced
a journal club, which allows members to dig more deeply into the education
literature, and connect with fellow educators.

** SeeME co-Founder and Director of Curriculum
:properties:
:custom_id: subsec:seeme
:end:

With my labmate Ohi Dibua, I founded [[http://seeme.stanford.edu][SeeME]] in the fall of 2016. SeeME is an
outreach program hosted by Stanford Mechanical Engineering which seeks to 1. Get
kids from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds excited about science and
engineering, and 2. Equip Stanford graduate students with teaching and speaking
skills. Our inaugural event was well-received, and garnered support from both
the department and the [[https://news.stanford.edu/2018/04/30/graduate-students-teach-local-teens-engineering/][university at large]].

*** Outreach Activities
Currently, SeeME runs an annual outreach event. We bring roughly 50 middle- and
high-school aged students to Stanford's campus through program-sponsored
transportation, in order for attendees to take part in graduate-student led
courses on engineering topics. Past classes have covered bird flight, autonomous
cars, mathematical modeling for disease control, and many other topics. Our
program was founded specifically to reach traditionally underrepresented groups,
and we are constantly striving to improve our efforts.

[[./images/seeme2017.png]]

More recently we have taken SeeME on the road. We brought a fluid mechanics demo
to the Bay Area Science Festival in November of 2018. This was an excellent
chance to introduce flow visualization to young kids, get them thinking about
fluid mechanics in the air around them, and advertise our annual event. We are
currently working to expand SeeME's offerings, in order to achieve a more
sustained impact on our broader community.

*** Personal Contribution
My specific contributions to SeeME have been in spearheading its founding,
helping to define its mission and establishing it as a supported part of the
Mechanical Engineering Department at Stanford.

Today I serve as SeeME's Director of Curriculum: My job is to ensure SeeME
executes on goal 2: Equip Stanford graduate students with teaching and speaking
skills. I do this by leveraging my experience and contacts as a [[#subsec:vptl][VPTL teaching
consultant]], organizing workshops to train our teachers and provide them guidance
on course design -- a task many of them have never done before. I also organize
our annual 'dress rehearsal', which gives our teachers a chance to practice
their course, and gain targeted, timely feedback. I am also involved with with
the miscellaneous tasks needed to make SeeME happen; I often take part in our
annual event's opening ceremony with my "Engineering is for Everyone" activity.
