          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="lead"> This was a three-week team project to design a bipedal walking robot with significant character expression. My personal focus in the project was on the design of a coupled multi-degree-of-freedom linkage system driven by cams to provide a statically determinant 'shuffle' gait. With a partner, I created a parametric linkage model for the system, developed a system for keyframe cam design, and wrote numerical methods to optimize the resulting cam profiles.</p>

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>Introduction to Mechanical Design is a required course for all Mechanical Engineers at Olin. The course is designed to bring together the students' past theoretical and practical experiences and build a firm foundation of mechanical design knowledge. The final project for this course is usually an intensive mechanical design study. In my year the class was tasked with designing a practical version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXlmQ1ilpbs&feature=youtu.be">Jimmy</a>, a bipedal walking robot intended to be 3D printed and assembled by consumers. Since the entire system was intended to be produced on a consumer budget of $2000, the project was highly constrained.</p>
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>My particular job on this project was to work with a partner to make sure the robot could walk. Bipedal motion is a difficult problem, and an active field of research. In order to avoid complicated dynamic modeling and accomplish a working gait in a three-week timeframe and on a shoestring budget, we elected to use a statically determinant 'shuffle' gait. Our robot keeps two feet in contact with the ground at all times, rocking its feet to contact the front and rear sections of the foot, which have different frictional properties. This motion is achieved via a coupled multi-degree-of-freedom leg system driven by cams.</p>
        <p>Our system uses a seven-bar linkage with a rotating foot, all controlled by links driven off three coaxial cams. This system allowed us to design a load-bearing linkage system in parallel with the necessary cam profiles. We first generated a critical dimension sketch to fix design parameters. My partner then focused on designing the linkage system, while I worked to generate the necessary cam profiles. The method I used was one of interpolating keyframes - I built a rough mockup of the linkage system, used Solidworks Motion Analysis tools to generate the desired leg movements, and recorded each of the three cam follower distances at numerous keyframes. This provided the data necessary to generate cam profiles. Unfortunately, this first pass did not function as intended.</p>
        <p>Since real cam followers have nonzero radii, the point of contact between cam and follower is not always on the line between their rotational centers. This results in some error, which contributed to very strange motion with the original cam profiles. My partner and I decided to write a numerical method to iteratively converge on the desired cam profile. Our initial attempts to use Newton's Method and Gradient Descent were unsuccessful, as the problem space is too computationally expensive to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time. We finally settled on a method which uses local information only. Since the cam distance is only affected by local points anyway, our method was both effective and computationally inexpensive.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, our design achieved our internal goals, and was well received by our professors and peers.</p>

          <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p>One of the first required courses at Olin is Design Nature, a course where students design and build a bio-inspired children's toy. The project lasts about two months, involving a lengthy process of design and iteration. However, there is a challenge among Olin students to redo the entire project in 24 hours - the Design Nature Challenge. In my Senior year, I organized a team to tackle the Design Nature Challenge.</p>
          <p>The rules of the Design Nature Challenge are simple: build a bio-inspired children's toy in 24 hours or less. The design constraints are identical to those of Design Nature; teams are limited to a 12"x24"x1/8" sheet of delrin, three servo motors, and a $50 budget. Our design process began at a 8:00 PM on December 16, when the entire team picked an animal motion and a mechanism; we ultimately settled on a sea turtle, and used a spiral cam driving a pair of four bar linkages to produce a rowing motion for the front legs. In order to ensure the system would integrate flawlessly, we took a page from the software industry and utilized pair CAD-ing with a projector. This allowed us to generate and display a critical dimension sketch which was visible to the team throughout the entire design process. Our design process was captured in a time lapse video, shown here.</p>

          <p>Our fabrication process began the following morning. We used a Legend 32EX Laser Cutter to cut the base plate and linkage elements, a Replicator 2 to print the motor mounts and other interface parts, and a 3-axis router to cut the shell. Ultimately, we stole 30 minutes for dinner, and finished the system at 8:30 PM on December 17. At the deadline, the system had a fully-functional mechanism and a stand-in cosmetic shell. Past the deadline, we made minor improvements and added the full cosmetic components.</p>

      <h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>Early in my senior fall semester, my boss (the head of the Olin College machine shop) tasked me with devising a better way to actuate the fume hood chute for the welding booth. I approached this problem by first generating a half-dozen potential solutions, and presented them to my boss, who provided feedback on the feasibility and manufacturability of each design. Together, we selected a design based on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoekens_linkage'>Hoekens Mechanism</a>, which generates linear motion from a rotational input.</p>
      <p>I then moved into a phase of more detailed design, and generated a full CAD model for the system. Once satisfied with the model, I began fabrication of the parts. The majority of operations were accomplished using a Vertical Mill, which I used to make the mounting brackets, mill keyways, and profile the ends of the linkages (using CNC functionality). Sheet metal tabs were TIG welded to square tubes to form linkage bars with clevis connections, which formed the bulk of the mechanism.</p>
      <p>The rightmost bar in the image above is the driving bar, which is connected to the handle via keyed shaft. This drives the linkage system, which pulls a Delrin interface bar, which connects to the chute door via a simple sheet-metal bracket. An easy quarter-turn of the handle slides the chute door open or closed. This new mechanism is a vast improvement over the old method actuating the door (by waving a PVC tube around until it catches the lip and opens the door).</p>

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping is a course intended to introduce students to good mechanical design concepts and prototyping techniques. The course involves a number of design and fabrication projects to introduce students to structural, transmission, and power systems, Additionally, the course introduces design considerations and fabrication techniques behind 3D printing, sheet metal working, polymer casting, and laser cutting.</p>
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>For the final project, I worked on a three person team to design and fabricate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underactuation"> underactuated </a>robotic hand. Underactuation (in this case) allows the fingers of the hand to react to objects as it closes, curving around contours to effectively grip objects of various sizes and shapes. Our system achieves underactuation by implementing a compliant finger mechanism, which uses a flexible polymer cast into 3D printed parts to form a joint, which is designed with particular bending moduli to provide the desired order of finger actuation. The joints nearest the base have the thinnest polymer joints - thus they tend to bend first, allowing the fingers to exhibit gross movements before they begin to curl. This design allows the fingers to react to objects and curl around contours, much like a human hand.</p>
