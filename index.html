I believe false certainty is one of the greatest challenges we face in the 21st
century. False certainty contributed to voter complacency in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-story-of-2016/">2016 election</a>.
Citing a lack of certainty is the favorite tactic of <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-thinking-error-at-the-root-of-science-denial-96099">climate change deniers</a>. In
my own work, I have found that the <i>reification</i> of variable material properties
in Engineers' minds has lead to undiagnosed vulnerabilities in the aircraft
design process.

Generally, people tend to seek absolute knowledge where it does not exist,
closing themselves off from the possibility of learning. My research, teaching,
and service are all connected to the same goal&#x2014;helping us manage uncertainty.

<p>
I first trained as a mechanical engineer at <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a>, whose
curriculum emphasizes a <a href="http://www.olin.edu/academics/curriculum/">people-first</a> approach to problem solving. There I
developed the tools and mindset to identify and frame human problems&#x2014;a
skillset I carried to my graduate studies. At Stanford I am completing a PhD in
Aerospace Engineering under the supervision of <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jops">Gianluca Iaccarino</a> and <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/art-b-owen">Art Owen</a>.
My mix of interviewing skills and statistical literacy enabled me to elicit
problems from engineers while interning at Northrop Grumman Corp., which
directly led to my work on <a href="#subsec:margin">principled margin</a>.

the <a href="https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab">Data Challenge Lab</a>, and I incorporate statistics and data science in my
research, teaching, and service. My graduate training in statistics has enabled
me to pursue a rigorous treatment of uncertainty in my work on <a href="#subsec:margin">principled

<p>
I am interested in how information&#x2014;in a broad sense&#x2014;flows through the
engineering design process. Modern advances in data collection, computation, and
algorithms have opened the door to new ways to find engineering and scientific
insights. These developments enable new approaches to old engineering problems,
and promise increased efficiency and safety. The following are major themes of
my research:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-subsec:margin">
<p>
Engineers design safe solutions for human needs. Designers achieve safety in
part through <i>engineering margins</i>&#x2014;essentially 'padding' in the quantitative
values used for design. If you've ever put aside money for a rainy day, you're
not just fiscally responsible&#x2014;you've built margin into your finances! My work
on principled margin is focused on deriving data-driven engineering margins with
provable properties.

<h4 id="orgd9e3174"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.1</span> A Dangerous, Reified Mindset</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House:_The_Spread_of_Excellence_from_Plato_to_Darwin">Gould</a> tied the notion of <i>reification</i>, "the mental conversion of a person or
abstract concept into a thing," to failed statistical reasoning. <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/useless-arithmetic/9780231132121">Pilkey and
Pilkey-Jarvis</a> tie this fallacy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery">dramatic failures</a> in environmental science.
They quote Gould to illustrate the key issue,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"We abstract the variation within a system into some measure of central tendency
like the mean value and then make the mistake of reifying this abstraction and
interpreting the mean as a concrete thing."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Engineers also commit this reification in considering <i>material properties</i> as
simple, single numbers to be plugged into models. In my PhD thesis, I worked to
articulate the failure modes of these <i>reification errors</i> in the context of
aircraft structural design, and developed provably safe alternatives.

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span><i>Widely-used aircraft design strategies have fundamental flaws.</i> The use of <i>basis values</i>&#x2014;conservative, reified material properties&#x2014;can lead to a misleading safe diagnosis of structures. Note that the `Apprx.` Limit State value using a basis value indicates a safe structure for `2`, while the `True` value is unsafe. This and other issues in aircraft design arise from a reified view of material properties, and require a more rigorous approach to guarantee aircraft safety.</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<p>
Rigorously treating uncertainties in science and engineering is the study of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification">uncertainty quantification</a> (UQ). As a researcher in UQ, I use a combination of
domain knowledge of aircraft design and rigorous statistics to solve engineering
problems. I have developed alternatives to traditional structural design
criteria which possess <i>provable safety properties</i>. These approaches are
data-informed to add a rigorous amount of design margin.

Scientists and engineers need to carry out analyses and make decisions. Data
science tools have the potential to support these activities, but interpreting
data requires reasoning under uncertainty. I have worked on projects in a
variety of different areas, but these efforts have a common thread: Managing
uncertainty to support analysis and decisions.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-subsec:me470">
<p>
In the Spring of 2019 I designed and taught the Stanford course ME 470:
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). I designed this class partly as an introduction
to the methods, but primarily as an introduction to the <i>mindset</i> of how to
manage uncertainty.

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span><i>Modeling choices tend to have far greater impact than parametric choices on an analysis.</i> Visual comparison of Lord Kelvin's and John Perry's analyses of earth cooling, both used to estimate the age of the earth. Note that while parametric changes (different values of L) in Perry's analysis shift the blue curves, there is a qualitative difference in predictions between the Kelvin and Perry models. While much attention in UQ is placed on dealing with parametric issues, modeling choices tend to dominate behavior: This was a key lesson in ME 470. <i>Figure reproduced from <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:7854d3c6-676f-445a-918d-0a28ecb9b6a0">GSA Today</a> article by England, Molnar, and Richter.</i></p>
</div>

<p>
As an illustration, we started the first day with a <a href="./docs/me470_kelvin.pdf">hands-on</a> exercise studying
Lord Kelvin's (incorrect!) estimation of the age of the earth. Through this
exercise, students identified potential sources of <i>model-form
uncertainty</i>&#x2014;errors in the posed equations used to describe a physical system.
Students also practiced determining what information would be necessary to
improve an analysis. Through this and similar exercises, students in ME 470
learned not just the mathematics to carry out UQ, but also the <i>investigative
mindset</i> needed to manage uncertainty.

build a robust community of educators at Stanford, providing a network for those
students, staff, and faculty who are passionate about education.
</p>

<p>
Stanford ASEE offers a seminar sequence and annual colloquium. During my work
with the chapter, we produced the 2018 Colloquium on <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/asee/cgi-bin/wordpress/2018/04/11/asee-colloquium-education-at-scale-april-20th-845am-1230pm/">Education at Scale</a>, which
examined the modern challenges and opportunities of scale, and the 2019
Colloquium on <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/asee/cgi-bin/wordpress/2019/04/17/asee-colloquium-april-19th-2019/">The Fundamentals of Teaching</a>, where participants learned the key
skills for effective pedagogy through interactive workshops. We also introduced
a journal club, which allows members to dig more deeply into the education
literature, and connect with fellow educators.

With my labmate Ohi Dibua, I founded <a href="http://seeme.stanford.edu">SeeME</a> in the fall of 2016. SeeME is an
outreach program hosted by Stanford Mechanical Engineering which seeks to 1. Get
kids from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds excited about science and
engineering, and 2. Equip Stanford graduate students with teaching and speaking
skills. Our inaugural event was well-received, and garnered support from both
the department and the <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/04/30/graduate-students-teach-local-teens-engineering/">university at large</a>.

<p>
Currently, SeeME runs an annual outreach event. We bring roughly 50 middle- and
high-school aged students to Stanford's campus through program-sponsored
transportation, in order for attendees to take part in graduate-student led
courses on engineering topics. Past classes have covered bird flight, autonomous
cars, mathematical modeling for disease control, and many other topics. Our
program was founded specifically to reach traditionally underrepresented groups,
and we are constantly striving to improve our efforts.

More recently we have taken SeeME on the road. We brought a fluid mechanics demo
to the Bay Area Science Festival in November of 2018. This was an excellent
chance to introduce flow visualization to young kids, get them thinking about
fluid mechanics in the air around them, and advertise our annual event. We are
currently working to expand SeeME's offerings, in order to achieve a more
sustained impact on our broader community.

our annual 'dress rehearsal', which gives our teachers a chance to practice
their course, and gain targeted, timely feedback. I am also involved with with
the miscellaneous tasks needed to make SeeME happen; I often take part in our
annual event's opening ceremony with my "Engineering is for Everyone" activity.
